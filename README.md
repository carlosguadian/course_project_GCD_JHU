# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is Carlos Guadi√°n's course project for Getting and Cleaning Data. 

## Steps to do

* Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Contents
This repository has the following files:

* README.md to intro the repo and explain its content.
* run_analysis.R is the R script to do the described analysis.
* codebook.md modifies and updates the available codebook original with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
* FinalData.txt is the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run the analysis

* First check if the needed libraries are installed, if not, the script it will install and load.
* Then select and run the script.
